OK so I want to set up a super minimal app that has a lot of different
components so I can set up a kubernetes.

1- minimal web app.  just return 'hi'
2- web app tester.  just a pytest that checks for 'hi'
3- jenkins
4- kubernetes
5- database


We need a git server.  Let's set it up on xps first, then in a docker
container, then maybe on linode or something.

Meh just gonna use a git user on my system and let jenkins connect via ssh.
Don't need a git webserver.  Can set that up later.

stock Jenkins docker image doesn't have docker support ... so how does that work?
Can I build docker images in a jenkins docker, or do I need to run it natively?
